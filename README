USAGE

./driver <inputfile> -s <frame width> <frame height> -t <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2> -w <mode> <outputfile>

where -s flags that the following 2 integers are the width and height of the "frame" respectively.
      -t flags the next 4 integers as the start and end coordinates for the top-left corner of the frame.
      -w flags the next 2 strings as the mode (none, invert, reverse, revinvert) of the sequence and the name of the outpul files respectively.
      inputfile is the name of the PGM file to extract a frame sequence from.
